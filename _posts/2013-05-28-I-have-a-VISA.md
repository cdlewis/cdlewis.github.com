After a long and arduous process I finally have VISAs to study and travel in the United States. Now all I need is somewhere to stay!

The complexity of the process will challenge even the most seasoned form-fillers. Now that I'm on the other side, I thought I'd put all my redundant VISA knowledge to use by constructing a map for future adventurers.

I've been told that, if anything, this doesn't do the process justice. Keep in mind that complexity increases exponentially with each additional form rather than linearly. Even a simple change such as consolidating the fees and making them all payable online would go a long way towards simplifying the process.

Thankfully the people at the US Consulate acknowledge these difficulties and do everything they can to help you get through it in one piece.
