My Macbook Pro (2009) has had a good run but I wanted to install Windows 8 and 50gb of free space wasn't going to cut it.

I ended up getting a [Seagate 500gb Hybrid SSHD](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003NSBF32), which was only $93 at MSY. It has 500gb (7200RPM) regular hard drive and uses an onboard controller to automatically cache frequently accessed files on a 5gb SSD. Giving you the benefit of relatively fast read times coupled with a decent amount of storage.

## Installation

In theory, the process should have been:
1. Install SSHD;
2. On boot, laptop can't find OSX and enters recovery mode;
3. Restore latest backup from time capsule.

Physical installation was pretty [straight forward](http://www.macinstruct.com/node/407), apart from almost forgetting to attach the T6 Trox screws to the side of the new hard drive, which may have caused some issues.

Boot to recovery also worked like a charm. Unfortunately, restore from time capsule backup did not. I kept getting an error message saying that it was 'unable to restore the recovery partition'. In the end I had to install Snow Leopard from an old DVD, upgrade to Mountain Lion (which presumably installs the recovery partition) and then, finally, restore from the time capsule backup.

## Windows 8

Installing on a Pre-2010 Macbook [can be non-trivial](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4897066). Rather than mess with Boot Camp plist files, I found it was much easier to:
1. Create a FAT32 partition using Disk Utility;
2. Download the latest version of the [Boot Camp Support Software](http://support.apple.com/downloads/#macoscomponents) and copy it to a USB;
3. Insert Windows 8 DVD, restart, install;
4. Install Boot Camp Support Software from USB.

## Profit

Loving the new SSHD. It's quiet, fast, and has twice the storage capacity of the original. Get around it.
