## Me

My name is Christopher Lewis. I was born in Melbourne, Australia and am currently a JD (law) student at The University of Melbourne. Before starting my JD, I completed a computer science degree at the same institution.

I’m interested in programming, startups, technology, law, politics and history (no particular order).

I’ve worked in a number of positions related to public policy, law and technology. To find out more about my professional and academic experience, [click here](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=192485903 "LinkedIn").
