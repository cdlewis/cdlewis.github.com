My name is Christopher Lewis. I’m 23 years old and currently living in Melbourne, Australia.

By day I study law at the University of Melbourne. Before this I completed an undergraduate degree in computer science. I’ve also worked in a number of positions related to public policy, law and technology. To find out more about my professional and academic experience, [click here](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=192485903 "LinkedIn").

I’m interested in programming, startups, technology, law, politics and history.

I see this blog as a place to show some of my past work and talk about various things that interest me.
