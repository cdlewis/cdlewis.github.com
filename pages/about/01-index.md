I'm originally from Melbourne, Australia. Now I build cool stuff for [IJ](http://www.ij.com), a DC based social news company that serves millions of Americans daily with shareable, informative, and mobile friendly content. Before that I spent way too much time in [school](http://www.unimelb.edu.au), eventually graduating with degrees in computer science and law.

At the moment I'm working a lot with [Go](http://www.golang.org) and [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) to create the great online experiences for our writers and readers.
