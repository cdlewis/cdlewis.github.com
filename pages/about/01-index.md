## Me

I'm a computer science / law graduate currently building cool stuff for the [Media Group of America](http://mgofa.com), which includes [IMGE](http://imge.com) and [IJ](http://www.ij.com]).

## The Blog

This site is built with [Jekyll-Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com) and hosted on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com). It uses heavily modified version of [Kevin Xue's](https://github.com/kevinxueliang/jb-svbtle) [Svbtle](https://svbtle.com) clone. The source code for which can be found [here](https://github.com/cdlewis/cdlewis.github.com).
