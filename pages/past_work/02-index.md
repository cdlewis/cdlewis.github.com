Over the years I've worked on a number of web projects, a collection of which can be found on this page. If you have a particular project in mind, please [get in touch](mailto:chris.lewis2@gmail.com).

## Thread Café

Thread is a Malvern based speciality coffee shop. The website is still live and can be found [here](http://www.threadcafe.com.au). Site uses custom Wordpress theme, Facebook integration and high-res photography.

## Melbourne University Law Review

As the core layout and functionality was already provided by the University's CMS, work mainly involved adding content and modifying features as needed, e.g. Twitter feed. The site is still online and can be found [here](http://www.mulr.com.au).
