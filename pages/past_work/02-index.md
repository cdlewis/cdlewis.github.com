I've worked on a number of web projects, some of which can be found on this page.

## Menzies House

Founded in 2010, Menzies House is not-for-profit policy blog, which went through a design refresh/relaunch in 2014.
The site uses a custom Wordpress theme with full social media integration and designed with high traffic volume in mind.

## Melbourne University Law Review

As the core layout and functionality was already provided by the University's CMS, work mainly involved adding content and modifying features as needed, e.g. Twitter feed. The site is still online and can be found [here](http://www.mulr.com.au).
