This page contains some of my past web-development projects. The images link to site if it is still live.

## [Menzies House](http://www.menzieshouse.com.au)

Menzies House is forum for policy discussion with an emphasis on classical liberalism. I was responsible for the current look, which was part of a broader relaunch in 2014. It uses a custom Wordpress theme with social media integration and was designed to accommodate high volumes of traffic.

## [Melbourne University Law Review](http://www.mulr.com.au)

As the core layout and functionality was already provided by the University's CMS, work mainly involved adding content and modifying features as needed, e.g. Twitter feed.
