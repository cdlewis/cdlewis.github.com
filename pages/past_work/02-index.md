## [Projects at IMGE/MGA](http://www.mgofa.com)

I've had the opportunity to work  on a lot of cool projects with some really talented people during my time at IMGE and MGA.

'Create Your Own $10' was in response to reports that a women would be featured on the new $10 bill. It runs on NodeJS/Express and uses Amazon S3 to store the images.

For the American Unity Fund's marriage equality campaign we build a map of America filled (dynamically) with the faces of those who had signed the petition (either from social media or through manual user upload). The map is created from ASCII art and is therefore completely customisable.

As part of the launch of Shuffle, IMGE Labs' social news App, we built a single page website to showcase some of its features. The website had some cool effects like animated transitions under a blurred image.

As the core layout and functionality was already provided by the University's CMS, work mainly involved adding content and modifying features as needed, e.g. Twitter feed.
